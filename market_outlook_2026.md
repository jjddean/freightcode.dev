- **Key Drivers:**
  - E-commerce explosion (Asia-EU/US routes).
  - Demand for real-time visibility & compliance automation.
  - SMB shift from Excel/Email to Digital SaaS.

## 3. Success Factors (The "Why")
- **Hybrid Trust:** The "Approval Workflow" we built allows platform admins to gate high-risk actions (bookings, payments) while clients self-serve. This solves the "trust gap" in fully digital platforms.
- **Modern Stack:** Convex/React allows rapid iteration vs legacy competitors.
- **AI Readiness:** Data structure (Audit Logs, DocuSign flow) is ready for "Approval Agents" and Predictive Analytics.

**Realistic Goal:** Reach $5–20M ARR in 3–5 years → **$50–200M Valuation** (Exit or Scale).
