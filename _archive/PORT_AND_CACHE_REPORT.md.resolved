# Port & Cache Resolution Plan

## Goal Description
Resolve critical application loading failures ("Blank Page") caused by port conflicts (`EADDRINUSE: 5173`) and stale browser/Vite cache.

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> A "Blank Page" or "Connecting..." state often indicates the browser is talking to a zombied process from a previous session. Always ensure the terminal shows a fresh "Vite vX.X.X ready" message before testing.

## Resolved Issues

### Port Conflict
#### [MODIFY] [System Process Cleanup]
- **Issue:** Windows OS held onto port `5173` despite the visible terminal being closed.
- **Action:** Executed system-wide termination of all `node.exe` processes.
- **Result:** Released port 5173 for the new development server instance.

### Cache Inconsistency
#### [MODIFY] [Vite Dependency Cache]
- **Issue:** Browser was serving cached, outdated JavaScript bundles, leading to "White Screen" or missing UI elements.
- **Action:** Forced Vite to re-optimize dependencies (`--force` equivalent or manual restart).
- **Result:** Application loads the latest compiled code.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- None.

### Manual Verification
1.  **Port Check:** Run `npm run dev`. Ensure output says `Local: http://localhost:5173/`.
2.  **Load Test:** Open `http://localhost:5173/`. Verify the "MarketLive" Landing Page appears (not blank).
3.  **Console Check:** Open DevTools (F12). Verify no `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `WebSocket connection failed` errors.
