**MarketLive Launches the First "Zero-Cost Operating System" for SMB Freight Forwarders**

*New platform brings Enterprise-grade Predictive Risk Intelligence to the SMB market for free.*

**LONDON, UK — January 29, 2026** — MarketLive today announced the public beta launch of its self-serve logistics platform, designed to democratize access to advanced freight technology for Small and Mid-sized Business (SMB) freight forwarders.

For decades, powerful Transport Management Systems (TMS) have been locked behind expensive enterprise contracts, leaving smaller forwarders to rely on spreadsheets and email. MarketLive breaks this cycle by offering a comprehensive suite of tools—including Quoting, Booking, Documentation, and Compliance—completely free of charge.

**Introducing GeoRisk Navigator™**
The flagship feature of the launch is GeoRisk Navigator™, a predictive intelligence engine that analyzes trade lanes for geopolitical, physical, and compliance risks in real-time.

"The logistics map is being rewritten daily by conflict, climate, and regulation," said [Founder Name], Founder of MarketLive. "Big forwarders have armies of analysts. SMBs have Excel. We are leveling the playing field by giving every forwarder a 'Risk Radar' right in their dashboard."

**Key Features of MarketLive:**
*   **Unified Dashboard**: Manage Quotes, Bookings, and Shipments in one view.
*   **GeoRisk Navigator™**: 0-100 Risk Scoring for global routes.
*   **Auto-Documentation**: Instant generation of BOLs and Commercial Invoices.
*   **Compliance Hub**: KYC and Sanction screening tools.

MarketLive is available immediately for free signups at [marketlive.io](https://marketlive.io).

**About MarketLive**
MarketLive is the operating system for the modern independent freight forwarder. Built on the belief that logistics technology should be accessible to all, MarketLive provides operator-grade tools without the enterprise price tag.
