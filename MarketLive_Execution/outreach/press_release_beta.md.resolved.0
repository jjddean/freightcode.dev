**MarketLive Launches GeoRisk Navigator™: Bringing Enterprise-Grade Intelligence to SMB Forwarders**

**London, UK** —— MarketLive, the operating system for the modern independent freight forwarder, today announced the launch of **GeoRisk Navigator™**.

For too long, predictive supply chain intelligence was a luxury reserved for multi-billion dollar logistics giants. Small and mid-sized forwarders (SMBs) were forced to operate blindly, relying on reactive tracking data that only flagged problems after they occurred.

**MarketLive changes that starting today.**

"Forwarders don't need another map showing them where their stuck cargo is," said the Founder of MarketLive. "They need a radar that tells them where NOT to go. GeoRisk Navigator™ provides that foresight."

**Key Features:**
*   📍 **Predictive Risk Scoring:** Real-time 0-100 scoring of shipping lanes based on conflict, congestion, and volatility.
*   ⚠️ **Pre-Booking Alerts:** Warnings appear *during* the quoting process, allowing forwarders to protect their margins before committing.
*   🧠 **Democratized Access:** Available immediately to all "Business" tier subscribers—no enterprise contracts required.

**About MarketLive**
MarketLive is the all-in-one SaaS platform for independent freight forwarders. From instant quotes to automated compliance, we give SMBs the tools to punch above their weight.
