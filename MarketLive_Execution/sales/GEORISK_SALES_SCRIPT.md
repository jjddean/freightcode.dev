## Script Structure

### Opening (30 seconds)
**What to say:**
> "I'd like to show you GeoRisk Navigator™ — our route-level risk intelligence module. This is designed for teams managing complex trade lanes where geopolitical conditions, sanctions exposure, or weather disruptions can impact operations."

**Pause here.** Let them confirm relevance.

---

### Demo Flow (4-5 minutes)

#### Scenario 1: Low Risk (London → Rotterdam)
**What to show:**
- Click "Low Risk" scenario
- Point to the risk score: **15/100**
- Highlight the advisory: *"Route appears stable. Standard procedures apply."*

**What to say:**
> "For stable routes like intra-Europe, the system confirms low risk. You see the weighted breakdown — zone risk, sanctions screening, weather factors. This gives your team confidence to proceed with standard protocols."

**Pause.** Let them absorb the UI.

---

#### Scenario 2: Medium Risk (Mumbai → Rotterdam via Suez)
**What to show:**
- Click "Medium Risk" scenario
- Point to the score: **68/100**
- Click "View Risk Breakdown" to expand details
- Highlight: *"Transit via Suez Canal - elevated maritime risk"*

**What to say:**
> "Now, a more complex route. The system flags Suez transit as elevated maritime risk. The advisory recommends reviewing routing options and preparing contingency plans. This is the kind of prescriptive guidance that helps operations teams make informed decisions without waiting for manual research."

**Key phrase:** "Prescriptive guidance" — not just data, but actionable recommendations.

---

#### Scenario 3: High Risk (Dubai → Tehran)
**What to show:**
- Click "High Risk" scenario
- Point to the score: **88/100**
- Expand the breakdown
- Highlight sanctions match and weather factors

**What to say:**
> "For high-risk routes — like this example involving Iran — the system surfaces sanctions exposure, geopolitical tensions, and current weather conditions. The advisory suggests alternative routing, additional insurance, or enhanced due diligence. This is where GeoRisk Navigator™ becomes a compliance safeguard, not just a tracking tool."

**Critical pause.** This is where enterprise buyers lean in.

**Address the elephant in the room:**
> "You'll notice this uses representative data. In production, this connects to live sanctions databases and weather APIs. We can discuss activation timelines based on your compliance requirements."

---

#### Scenario 4: Free Tier (Shanghai → LA)
**What to show:**
- Click "Free Tier" scenario
- Point to the limited data
- Highlight the upgrade prompt

**What to say:**
> "Our Free tier provides basic zone-based risk. For full sanctions screening and weather impact, that's available on Business and Enterprise plans. This tiered approach lets teams start with visibility and scale up as needed."

**Transition to pricing discussion.**

---

### Closing (1-2 minutes)

**What to say:**
> "The key value here is that GeoRisk Navigator™ shifts risk assessment from reactive to proactive. Instead of discovering compliance issues after booking, your team sees them upfront — at the quote stage. That's where the cost savings and risk mitigation happen."

**Pause for questions.**

---

## Handling Common Questions

### "Is this production-ready?"
**Answer:**
> "The backend is deployed and tested. We're using representative scenarios here for demo purposes. When we activate your account, it connects to live data sources. We can discuss your go-live timeline and any compliance requirements you have."

**Do NOT say:** "It's mock data" or "It's not live yet."

---

### "What data sources do you use?"
**Answer:**
> "We integrate with industry-standard sanctions databases and weather APIs. The specific sources depend on your compliance requirements and geographic coverage. We can provide a detailed data source audit during onboarding."

**Do NOT name:** OpenSanctions, OpenWeather, or any vendor names unless they ask specifically.

---

### "How accurate is the risk score?"
**Answer:**
> "The score is a weighted composite of zone risk, sanctions exposure, and weather factors. It's designed to be directional — not predictive. Think of it as a decision-support tool, not a guarantee. Your team still makes the final call, but with better information."

**Critical:** Never claim prediction or guarantee.

---

### "Can we customize the risk factors?"
**Answer:**
> "On Enterprise plans, yes. We can adjust the weighting, add custom risk factors, or integrate with your internal compliance systems. That's part of the onboarding process."

**Upsell opportunity.**

---

### "What's the difference between Business and Enterprise?"
**Answer:**
> "Business gives you full GeoRisk Navigator™ access — sanctions, weather, unlimited assessments. Enterprise adds custom risk factors, API access, dedicated support, and SLA guarantees. Most teams start with Business and upgrade as they scale."

**Keep it simple.**
