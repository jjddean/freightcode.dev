## Post 1 (The Problem)
**Headline**: "Tracking is dead. Long live Prediction."

Most freight dashboards tell you where your cargo *is*.
That's useful, but it's reactive.

If your container is stuck in Rotterdam, knowing it's stuck doesn't save your margin.

The new game is PREDICTION.
- Will this route be sanctioned next week?
- Is this port facing a strike?
- Is the canal water level too low?

At MarketLive, we built GeoRisk Navigator™ to answer these questions *before* you book.

Stop tracking failures. Start predicting success.
