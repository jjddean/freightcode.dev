**Post 1: The Launch 🚀**
*(Image: Media card showing a map with a Red Zone and a "Risk Score: 88" overlay)*

Stop betting on shipping lanes. 🎰
Standard tracking tells you where your cargo *is*.
**GeoRisk Navigator™** tells you where it *shouldn't go*.

We just launched the first predictive risk engine for SMB forwarders.
Know the delay risk before you book.

**Post 2: The Education 🧠**
"Cheapest" is usually most expensive. 📉
A $200 rate saving is worthless if it comes with a 14-day delay and $2k in demurrage.
In 2026, the best forwarders aren't selling price. They are selling specificty and certainty.
Use data to protect your margins.

How to audit a route in 10 seconds:
1.  Enter Origin/Dest 🗺️
2.  Click "Analyze Risk" ⚠️
3.  See the Score (0-100) 📊

If it's Red, re-route. If it's Green, book it.
Simple. Powerful.
Try it on MarketLive Business.

**Post 5: User Story 🚢**
"We avoided the port strike by 3 days."
That's the feedback we love to hear.
A MarketLive user checked their GeoRisk score, saw a "Labor Alert", and switched ports.
Cargo landed on time. Client happy.
Be that forwarder.
