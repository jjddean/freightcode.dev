Your job is to EXECUTE the zero-budget marketing & PR plan end-to-end using AI + free tools and my direction.

## GEORISK NAVIGATOR™ MARKETING PLAYBOOK

### Core Marketing Message
> "Don't just ship. Navigate the Risk."

Stop positioning as "cheaper" or "faster" — position as the **only forwarder that protects margins in volatile regions**.

### LinkedIn Authority Campaign (4-Week Sprint)

| Week | Theme | Post Focus |
|------|-------|------------|
| 1 | Education | "3 Geopolitical Flashpoints disrupting UK imports in 2026" |
| 2 | Reveal | "Why we built GeoRisk Navigator — standard tracking tells where, we tell if it's safe" |
| 3 | Case Study | "How an importer saved £12k in demurrage by predicting a port strike 4 days in advance" |
| 4 | CTA | "Opening 10 Beta Intelligence spots. Get a free Risk Audit of your routes." |

### High-Value Lead Magnets
- **"Red Zone" Report:** Monthly PDF of highest-risk shipping lanes
- **Route Risk Calculator:** Landing page with sample risk score
- **Compliance Checklist:** "Shipping to [Volatile Region]? 5 things your forwarder isn't telling you"

### Enterprise Sales Tactics (£199+ tiers)
Use the "Cost of Ignorance" framework:
1. **Identify Pain:** "What was your total loss last year due to unforeseen delays?"
2. **Introduce Shield:** "GeoRisk Navigator would have flagged that 72 hours before port arrival."
3. **ROI:** "One avoided delay pays for 5 years of Enterprise. It's insurance, not expense."

### Visual Marketing Assets
- **Heat Map Ad:** Dark map showing Safe vs Volatile zones with Freightcode as "Safe Passage"
- **Comparison Graphic:**
  - Standard: Tracking → Delay → Loss
  - Freightcode: GeoRisk Alert → Re-route → Margin Protected

### Strategic Partnerships
- Trade Insurance Brokers (referral fee / co-branded package)
- Geopolitical Newsletters (sponsor "Logistics Corner")
