# Project Rules

- **STRICT: No Unauthorized Edits**: absolutely DO NOT edit any file without getting explicit "Yes" or approval from the user first. Propose the change, wait for approval, then execute.
- **Wait for Instructions**: Always ask for instructions or verification before taking action on the codebase.
- **Single App focus**: Focus development on the main MarketLive application (port 8080).
