# Freightcode: The Zero-Budget Marketing Execution Master Plan

**Objective:** 3x monthly signups by Q4 2026 via "GeoRisk Navigator" niche dominance.
**Constraint:** £0 Budget. Organic & AI-driven only.

---

## 1. The Core Strategy: "Certainty as a Service"

We are pivoting from selling "freight forwarding" to selling **"Risk Navigation."**
In a market of commodity shipping, we sell the *absence* of surprise.

**The One-Liner:**
"Don't just ship. Navigate the Risk."

### The "GeoRisk" Hook
*   **Standard Forwarder:** Tracks the container.
*   **Freightcode:** Predicts the delay before booking.

*   **YouTube:** 3-min "Risk Audit" demo script.

### Phase 2: Outreach & PR (Week 1 - Ready to Pitch)

### Phase 3: Community (Launch)
